#Video game rush : Tower Defense

##Introduction :

Video game rush is a project taking place during the EPITA's Ing1. It has
a didactic purpose and should be considered as such. The goal of this project
is pretty straightforward : create a Tower Defense game, in 36 hours (actually
a bit more).

This project comes in two part, a mandatory one and a bonus one.
In order to ease the work of our ACU, we will split the project's features
regarding those two parts.

##Inspiration :

The worst thing about Tower Defense is repetitivity. Once you've played a
map once or twice, you know the perfect build order and turret placement in
order to win, or at least get as far as possible.

We wanted to change this system, and decided our game will generate as many
features as it can in apseudo random way.

This may lead to some conflict with the mandatory part,but we have faith in
our ACU's good will once he realises that he can playas many time as he wants
and not ending up twice on the same map, with the same mob route.

If you have something to remember about our project, it's that it will
always surprise you.


##Mandatory :

The mandatory features of our project are the following :

* Several (a LOT) of different maps, not hardcoded.
* Spawn point and nexus (our base).
* Economic (namely, bright and shiny GOLD)
* Several types of ennemies.
* Several types of towers.
* This documentation
* Display of the player's score and gold.

With the boring stuff done, we could go onto the real fun.

##Bonii

As you may have undersood, what we wanted was random, so here comes the good
stuff :

* Procedural creation of the maps with a seed. Unless specified in the
arguments, the seed will be given at random. You will then have a
a different map each time you load the game.

* Random creations of the waves. It will keep on getting harder as you
play

* Diffenent menus. We have a Start menu, and an in game HUD with a Pause
button.

* The towers have different types of attack, and can be placed only in
dinsinct places (more on that in the "How to play" part), all the
towers have different prices given their power.

* Hero towers. Crazy expensives towers that owns everything (or nearly so).

* buff towers, they give fix income you get at the end of each wave,
or heal your nexus.

* Dinstinct types of monster. They give various amount of gold given their
toughness.

* Menu and in game music

##How to play :

* Compile the project by placing yourself at its root and type make.

* Launch the project by typing ./tower .

* A window pops and the menu is displayed. Wait a few seconcds, your
map is being created.

* Click on "Play" (or on "Quit" if you're fed up already).

* Your map is displayed, place as many turret as you can, and click on
"Pause" to generate the first wave.

** In order to place turret, refer to the tips at the bottom of the screen
and press the according key to start a certain turret creation.

** If you're tigh on time, you can press pause anytime and still be able
to build turrest during that time.

* Play until you win/lose.

* replay/profit!.

##Conclusion :

We had a ton of fun designing and coding this project. There has been
no fights during its entire duration (it might seem like nothing but it's
actually a pretty big deal at EPITA). And we are proud of our final product.
We hope you will have as much fun playing as we have.
